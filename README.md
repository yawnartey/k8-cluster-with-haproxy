k8-cluster-with-haproxy
This is a mini project which seeks to explore the essence of K8s with HAProxy. The project explores how you can use haproxy as a load balancer to distribute traffic between 2 EC2 instances acting as a master node (or workernodes).This project will focus on using HAProxy to distribute traffic between 2 master nodes. The setup also include one EC2 instance acting as a worker node and another EC2 instance for our HAProxy. Our services will be containerised with K8s. This is how the setup will look like

MasterNode-1
MasterNode-2
WorkerNode-1
HAProxy

This project will use Terraform as IaC to setup and deploy our AWS resources
